          <h2>Deep learning vs. Machine learning</h2>

          <h3>Machine learning</h3>

          <p>Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on teaching computers 
              how to learn without being specifically programmed for certain tasks. The idea is to create 
              algorithms that learn from data and make predictions on data. Machine learning can be split 
              into three categories:</p>
          
            <ol>
                <li><em>Supervised learning</em>: the computer is given training data and the desired output from that data (e.g. category labels) and it has to learn from the training data in order to make meaningful predictions based on new data.</li>

                <li><em>Unsupervised learning</em>: the computer is given data only and it has to find meaningful structure or groups in the data by itself with no supervision.</li> 

                <li><em>Reinforcement learning</em>: the computer is interacting with the environment and learning via feedback which behaviors generate rewards. </li>
            </ol>
            <p> We will be using supervised learning for the task of classification.</p>
          
            <h3>Deep learning</h3> 

            <p>Deep learning is a subset of machine learning methods that use artificial neural networks. 
                It is somewhat inspired by the structure of the neurons of the brain. The "deep" in deep 
                learning refers to the multiple hidden layers of the neural networks. Deep learning has 
                had great success with several domains, such as images, text, speech, and video. There 
                are many different types of neural networks. We will focus on the following two:</p>
            <ol>
          <li>Multi-layer Perceptron (Fully connected network)</li>
          <li>Convolutional Neural Network</li>
          </ol>
            
            

            <h2>Why use deep learning?</h2> 
            <p>Deep learning is most appropriate when there are very complex patterns in the data you 
                want classified (and also lots of data). </p>   

            <h2> Perceptrons</h2>
            
          <p>To begin to understand neural networks we should understand what a perceptron is. 
              A perceptron is a basic artificial neuron. It takes in multiple binary inputs and 
              produces a single binary output. The inputs are given weights and the output is 
              determined by whether the sum of the input weights are over or under a certain threshold. 
              Essentially, it is a device that makes decisions by weighing all the evidence. </p>

            <img src="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/images/tikz0.png" class="center img-fluid">

            <p>Perceptrons can be combined together in layers to create a network. Each perceptron 
                (node) in a layer weighs the evidence of the perceptrons of the previous layer. 
                The first layer weighs the input evidence and makes a decision. The second layer weighs 
                the results of the first layer and makes a more complex/abstract decision, and so on, until 
                the final layer, where a final decision is made. </p>

            <img src="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/images/tikz1.png" class="center img-fluid">

            <p>The weights of the inputs of these networks are learned through learning algorithms 
                that minimize the errors in the final output. Nowadays, perceptrons are not really used 
                because their inputs and outputs are binary. Instead sigmoid neurons or other more powerful 
                activation functions like ReLU are often used. Sigmoid neurons operate very similar to perceptrons, 
                however they can take input values between 0 and 1 as well as give output values that are between 0 
                and 1. More on this later. </p>

            <h2>Structure of a Neural Network</h2>

            <p>A neural network is a highly structured network that has multiple layers. 
                The first layer is called the input layer and the final layer is called the output layer. 
                Every layer in between is referred to as a hidden layer. Each layer is made up of multiple nodes 
                (e.g. the perceptrons/sigmoid neurons from above). Each node of the hidden and output layers has 
                its own classifier and the results of the classifiers are passed forward to the next layer. These 
                multiple layer networks are often called <b>Multi-layer Perceptrons</b> (although they are typically 
                not actually using perceptrons). Neural networks like these, where the output from one layer is the 
                input for another, are called <b>feedforward</b> or <b>forward propagation</b> networks. There are neural 
                networks, called <b>Recurrent Networks</b>, where feedback loops can be used and information is not only 
                fed forward, however these are less popular and will not be used in this tutorial.</p>

            <img src="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/images/tikz11.png" class="center img-fluid">

            <h3>Input layer</h3>

            <p>The number of nodes in the input layer is determined by the number of inputs. For example, 
                say we are doing image classification and the input is a 28 by 28 pixel image. The model 
                would have one input node for each pixel. There are 784 (28x28=784) pixels in the image, 
                so there would be 784 input nodes.</p> 

            <h3>Output layer</h3>

            <p>The number of nodes in the output layer is determined by the number of categories the inputs 
          are being classified into. If it is a binary classification (2 options), the output layer has 1 
          node (the options are 0 or 1). If there are 5 possible categories, there are 5 nodes. </p>

            <h3>Hidden layers</h3>

            <p>The number of nodes in the hidden layers is chosen by the user. This is unfortunately not 
          determined by anything in particular and is one of the parameters that will need to be optimized. 
          It is best to test different amounts of nodes and see how it affects the outcome. </p>

             <h2>Training a neural network</h2>
          
            <p>In order to train a neural network we use a process called <b>back propagation</b>. It 
          is essentially a way of progressively correcting mistakes as soon as they are detected. Each layer
          of a network has a set of weights that determines the output of that layer for a given set of inputs. 
          In the beginning those weights are randomly assigned. The network is activated and values are propagated 
          forward through the network. Since we know the actual value of what the output should be we can calculate 
          the error in prediction. We then propagate the error backwards through the network and use a gradient descent 
          algorithm to adjust the weights to minimize the error. This process repeats until the error reaches 
          below a certain threshold. </p>

            <h2>One-hot encoding</h2>
            <p>Deep learning requires that the categories used in classification be represented by 
          one-hot encoding. This is done by representing the category of each input as a vector 
          the length of the number of categories. The vector is filled with 0's except for the 
          specific category belonging to that input. For example, imagine I have 10 samples and 
          the first 5 are from female subjects and the second 5 are from male subjects. I might 
          normally represent this data in a list of strings: <code>labels = [female, female, female, 
          female, female, male, male, male, male, male]</code> or better yet a list of integers 
          where <code>1 = male</code> and <code>2 = female</code>: <code>labels = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]</code></p>

           <p>One-hot encoding would change the represention from 1 and 2 to <code>male = [1, 0]</code> 
          and <code>female = [0, 1]</code> so that the ten subjects would be represented as: 
          <code>labels = [[0, 1], [0, 1], [0, 1], [0, 1], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 0], [1, 0], [1, 0]]</code>. 
          This can be further reduced to just <code>labels = [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1]</code>. </p>

           <p>Another example: If you had five categories: <code>[A, B, C, D, E]</code>, a sample belonging to
          category 'C' would be represented by <code>[0, 0, 1, 0, 0]</code>, a sample belonging to category 
          A would be represented by <code>[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]</code>. </p>
